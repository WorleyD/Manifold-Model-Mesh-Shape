# Manifold-Model-Mesh-Shape
An implementation of the Manifold Model for Shape Deformation outlined in a paper by Freifeld and Black

## Prerequisites 
The model requires python3 and numpy to run, disturbing the file structure for the datasets will almost certainly cause issues as well.

## Running information
Assuming the prerequisites are met, the model can be run from the command line by running   
```python ManifoldMeshModel.py```   
for a Windows system, substitute python3 for unix systems

By default, the model will load the 11 cat meshes from the TOSCA dataset and provide some analytic information from them.
